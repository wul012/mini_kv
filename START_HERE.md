# Start Here: mini_kv

## What this project does

This repository implements a Redis-like in-memory key-value store written in C++20.

Features:
- Thread-safe in-memory store
- WAL write-ahead logging
- TCP client-server communication
- RESP protocol support
- Runtime JSON evidence for commands and snapshots
- Command execution audit with SMOKEJSON/INFOJSON/KEYSJSON outputs
- CMake builds with CTest coverage across the command, WAL, snapshot, RESP, TCP, fixture, and governance evidence suites

## Why it matters

This project demonstrates systems engineering discipline in C++:

- Proper thread-safe data structures with minimal critical sections
- Command dispatch architecture and a long-running plan to split oversized command/evidence files without changing public output
- WAL, snapshot, restore, auto-compaction, and evidence correctness
- CI and test coverage to ensure runtime contracts and read-only governance boundaries

The README contains the long project history. New production-excellence progress is tracked in `docs/production-excellence-progress.md` so the README does not absorb another governance chain.

## How to run it

```powershell
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build --config Debug --parallel
ctest --test-dir build -C Debug --output-on-failure --timeout 120 --progress
./minikv_server.exe 6506 127.0.0.1
./minikv_client.exe
```

Follow the README for detailed command usage and screenshots.

## Top technical highlights

1. WAL + atomic append mutation separation
2. Command dispatch table and planned command-family split
3. C++20 thread-safe data structures with snapshot/recovery support
4. Full test coverage with CTest and runtime JSON verification

## Latest version summary

Current focus: **v1619 production-excellence K4 ready for planner review**. K3 has passed planner review, and K4 now has both required split slices landed: command execution is split into dispatch plus family executors, and `src/shard_readiness.cpp` has been reduced to the public fixture-path shim while SHARDJSON formatting, digest construction, and boundary/catalog helpers live in focused shard-readiness translation units. Public command output, fixtures, WAL/snapshot/RESP behavior, router authority, write authority, and execution authority stay unchanged. Do not start K5 until the K4 review checkpoint is complete.

Version scheme note: the CMake project version is still `0.102.0` because several historical runtime receipts intentionally identify the frozen v102 runtime fixture. Git tags carry the high-level delivery cadence (`v1608`, `v1609`, and later). The generated `minikv/version.hpp` exposes the CMake version plus a configurable archive hint; changing the hint is a contract decision, not a routine tag bump.
